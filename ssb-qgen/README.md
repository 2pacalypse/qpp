# Developed by Manos Athanassoulis & Ioannis Alagiannis
# This is a custom tool built to create randomized SSB queries.
# It can be used in conjuction with the SSB DBGEN which is available here: https://github.com/electrum/ssb-dbgen
# Usage:
# ./qgen.sh <qid> <seed>
# <qid> has the form qx_y where x.y are the different SSB queries (1.1, 1.2, ..., 2.1, ...). For example "./qgen.sh q3_2"
# <seed> is optional. If not used the random generator is initialized with the current date and time in seconds since 1970.
